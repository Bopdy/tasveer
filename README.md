# Welcome to Tasveer.live

A MERN based open source image community. Or you can say a social network. We
don't know what will be the final product yet. But I have very interesting ideas
and functionality in mind which can be implemented. Plus I am open to
suggestions.

Tasveer.live will be made with MERN (Mongodb, Express, React and Nodejs).

Calling out all the React and Nodejs developers to contribute in the project.
Here's the functionality that I have in mind.

## Functionality and Steps to Implement

- [ ] Design the project (Mobile First & Responsive) We need a unique and simple
      design. I'll add some mokups very soon.
- [ ] Users can post images, gifs, videos and links
- [ ] Users can go live
- [ ] Post stories
- [ ] Follow/Unfollow Feature
- [ ] Like other's posts
- [ ] Points system for staying and doing activities on the website
- [ ] User activity feed
- [ ] User wall
- [ ] Users can lock and sell their posts (We can think about this feature yet.
      But we need this functionality)
- [ ] Image filters
- [ ] Show if a member is online
- [ ] Explore section
- [ ] Show mutual likes, comments and followers We are open to ideas and
      functionality. Let's make this project this one rock.
